This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS as a part of UID project 1. Through this website I tried to showcase my skills, projects, and also made this website completely responsive. 
                           The main page of the website you will see when you open is the home page and you will then see a glowing about me button which will direct you to the about me section. And when you click on that it will re-direct you to the projects page where you can see all my projects with screenshots. You can see and download mu resume using the resume button in my home page. At last you can view my contact information and the links presented there will take you to my Github and LinkedIn profiles. The main features of this website are fully responsive design, built without using AI tools, interactive sections (Projects, etc.), Smooth scrolling, project showcases with live links and downloadable resume.
